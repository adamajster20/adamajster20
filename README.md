### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Boy with interests in electronics, music, drawing and space
Also fan of colorful ponies (brony)

(I don't know why I set my username to adamajster20, not to my usual AdamV20)

I've done many electronic projects, (i plan setting up a website with them) for example:
Speakers. Speakers are my life. Computer speakers, boombox-like ones, and big chungus ULTRA POWERFUL BASS 10W Speaker,
LM1875 stereo amplifier + NE5532 preamp with tone control (my everyday amp), TDA7265 Subwoofer amp, few am & fm radios, mini tesla coil, and other cool stuff.

Learning english.
Begginer in arduino's C
I made simple rtc clock and yeah, that's it xD

Currently in development:
NE555 class D stereo amp
Fully functional diy walkie-talkie
Coil-less AM receiver
VCartOn Semi-modular Analog Synthesizer

I'd like to learn how to make VST plugins

And, last, most important:
POLSKA GUROM!!!
